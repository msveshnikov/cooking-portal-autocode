# React Application Entry Point

## Overview

This code represents the entry point of a React application. It sets up the necessary providers and configurations for routing, theming, and state management. The application uses React Router for navigation, Material-UI for theming, and React Query for data fetching and caching.

## Imports

- `React`: The core React library.
- `ReactDOM`: Provides DOM-specific methods for React.
- `BrowserRouter`: React Router component for handling routing.
- `ThemeProvider`, `createTheme`: Material-UI components for theming.
- `CssBaseline`: Material-UI component for consistent baseline styles.
- `QueryClient`, `QueryClientProvider`: React Query components for data management.
- `App`: The main application component.
- `reportWebVitals`: Function to report web vitals metrics.

## Theme Configuration

### `theme`

A light theme created using Material-UI's `createTheme` function.

```javascript
const theme = createTheme({
  palette: {
    primary: { main: "#1976d2" },
    secondary: { main: "#dc004e" },
  },
});
```

### `darkTheme`

A dark theme created using Material-UI's `createTheme` function (currently unused).

```javascript
const darkTheme = createTheme({
  palette: {
    mode: "dark",
    primary: { main: "#90caf9" },
    secondary: { main: "#f48fb1" },
  },
});
```

## API Key

```javascript
export const apiKey = "8be8f9112d4f49e8bc35100bb649ce2b";
```

An API key exported for use in other parts of the application.

## React Query Configuration

```javascript
const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
      staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000,
    },
  },
});
```

Configures React Query with custom options:
- Disables refetching on window focus
- Sets a stale time of 5 minutes (300,000 milliseconds)

## Application Rendering

```javascript
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <Router>
        <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
          <CssBaseline />
          <App />
        </ThemeProvider>
      </Router>
    </QueryClientProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

Renders the application with the following structure:
1. Wraps the app in `React.StrictMode` for additional checks and warnings.
2. Provides React Query context with the configured `queryClient`.
3. Sets up routing with `Router`.
4. Applies the Material-UI theme using `ThemeProvider`.
5. Includes `CssBaseline` for consistent baseline styles.
6. Renders the main `App` component.

## Web Vitals Reporting

```javascript
reportWebVitals();
```

Calls the `reportWebVitals` function to start measuring and reporting web vitals metrics.

## Usage

This file should be the entry point of your React application. Typically, it would be named `index.js` or `main.js` and located in the `src` directory. To use this setup:

1. Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed.
2. Place this code in your entry file (e.g., `src/index.js`).
3. Create an `App` component and import it into this file.
4. Run your React application using the appropriate build tool (e.g., Create React App's start script).

Note: Make sure to keep the API key secure and consider using environment variables for sensitive information in production environments.
