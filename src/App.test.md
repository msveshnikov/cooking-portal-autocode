# App Component Test Suite Documentation

## Overview

This test suite is designed to validate the functionality and behavior of the `App` component in a React application. It uses Jest as the testing framework and React Testing Library for rendering and interacting with components. The tests cover various aspects of the application, including rendering, API interactions, user interactions, and UI features.

## Setup

The test suite uses the following key imports and configurations:

- React and related testing utilities from `@testing-library/react`
- `BrowserRouter` from `react-router-dom` for routing
- `axios` for API calls (mocked in these tests)
- Material-UI components and theming

A mock dataset (`mockRecipes`) is used to simulate API responses.

## Test Cases

### 1. Rendering App Title

**Description:** Verifies that the app title is rendered correctly.

**Test:** `renders app title`

### 2. Rendering Recipe List

**Description:** Ensures that the list of recipes is properly displayed.

**Test:** `renders recipe list`

### 3. API Call Verification

**Description:** Checks if the API call is made with the correct API key.

**Test:** `makes API call with correct key`

### 4. Multiple Pages Rendering

**Description:** Verifies that multiple pages (Home and Recipes) are accessible via navigation links.

**Test:** `renders multiple pages`

### 5. Material-UI Components Usage

**Description:** Confirms the use of Material-UI components in the app.

**Test:** `uses MUI components`

### 6. Dark Mode Toggle

**Description:** Tests the functionality of the dark mode toggle feature.

**Test:** `implements dark mode toggle`

### 7. Search Bar with Autocomplete

**Description:** Verifies the presence of a search bar with autocomplete functionality.

**Test:** `implements search bar with autocomplete`

### 8. Infinite Scrolling

**Description:** Tests the implementation of infinite scrolling for recipe loading.

**Test:** `implements infinite scrolling`

### 9. Favorites Feature

**Description:** Checks the functionality of adding recipes to favorites.

**Test:** `implements favorites feature`

### 10. Recipe Filtering

**Description:** Tests the recipe filtering functionality, specifically for vegetarian recipes.

**Test:** `implements recipe filtering`

### 11. Loading Skeletons

**Description:** Verifies the display of loading skeletons while content is being fetched.

**Test:** `displays loading skeletons`

### 12. Error Handling

**Description:** Tests the application's ability to handle and display errors gracefully.

**Test:** `handles errors gracefully`

## Usage

To run these tests, ensure that Jest and React Testing Library are properly set up in your project. Then, you can run the entire test suite or individual tests using Jest commands.

Example:
```
npm test
```
or
```
jest App.test.js
```

## Notes

- The tests use `axios.get.mockResolvedValue()` to mock API responses.
- `waitFor()` is used extensively to handle asynchronous operations.
- The tests cover both UI elements and functional aspects of the application.
- Material-UI components and themes are tested for presence and functionality.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the test suite for the App component, detailing each test case and its purpose. It serves as a guide for understanding the component's expected behavior and can be used as a reference for maintaining and expanding the application.
