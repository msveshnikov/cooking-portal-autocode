# RecipeDetail Component

## Overview

The `RecipeDetail` component is a React functional component that displays detailed information about a specific recipe. It fetches recipe data from the Spoonacular API and presents it in a structured layout using Material-UI components.

## Dependencies

-   React
-   react-router-dom
-   @mui/material
-   @mui/system
-   @mui/icons-material

## Constants

-   `API_KEY`: The Spoonacular API key used for authentication.

## Styled Components

-   `StyledPaper`: A styled version of Material-UI's Paper component with custom padding and margin.
-   `StyledImage`: A styled img element with full width, auto height, and rounded corners.

## Main Component: RecipeDetail

### State Variables

-   `recipe`: Stores the fetched recipe data.
-   `loading`: Boolean indicating whether the data is being fetched.
-   `error`: Stores any error message if the API request fails.

### Effects

The component uses the `useEffect` hook to fetch recipe data when the component mounts or when the `id` parameter changes.

### Render Logic

1. While loading, displays a centered CircularProgress.
2. If there's an error, shows an error message with an icon.
3. When data is loaded successfully, renders the recipe details in three sections:
    - Overview (title, image, summary, and diets)
    - Ingredients
    - Instructions

## Key Functions

### fetchRecipe (async)

An asynchronous function that fetches recipe data from the Spoonacular API.

#### Parameters

None (uses the `id` from useParams)

#### Returns

None (updates state variables)

#### Side Effects

-   Sets `recipe` state with fetched data
-   Sets `error` state if request fails
-   Sets `loading` state to false when complete

## Props

This component doesn't accept any props. It uses the `useParams` hook to get the recipe ID from the URL.

## Usage Example

```jsx
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from "react-router-dom";
import RecipeDetail from "./RecipeDetail";

function App() {
    return (
        <Router>
            <Switch>
                <Route path="/recipe/:id" component={RecipeDetail} />
                {/* Other routes */}
            </Switch>
        </Router>
    );
}
```

## Component Sections

1. **Recipe Overview**

    - Displays the recipe title, image, cooking time, summary, and diet tags.

2. **Ingredients**

    - Lists all ingredients with their amounts and units.

3. **Instructions**
    - Presents step-by-step cooking instructions in an ordered list.

## Error Handling

-   Displays a user-friendly error message if the API request fails.
-   Removes HTML tags from the recipe summary for clean text display.

## Accessibility

-   Uses semantic HTML elements (e.g., `<ol>` for instructions).
-   Includes alt text for the recipe image.

## Styling

-   Utilizes Material-UI's `styled` function for custom component styling.
-   Responsive layout using Material-UI's Grid system.

## Notes

-   Ensure that the `API_KEY` is valid and has necessary permissions.
-   The component assumes the Spoonacular API structure remains consistent.
